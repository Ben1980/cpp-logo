## License
[CC0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/) (public domain).

## Manifest
### Freedom
I publish this C++ Logo for public domain, so everyone can use, modify and redistribute it without any restrictions.

### History
I've acquired this logo from [isocpp/logos](https://github.com/isocpp/logos) when it was licensed under [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/) license (between [`90ab5cc`](https://github.com/isocpp/logos/commit/90ab5cc54e10635adf8aa62dd7f6094df20995e6) and [`a036ea6`](https://github.com/isocpp/logos/commit/a036ea65afa8b5f5ba7733f90d9aed8266eca6c1)).<br>
On 18.04.2017, [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/) license has been revoked by [`a036ea6`](https://github.com/isocpp/logos/commit/a036ea65afa8b5f5ba7733f90d9aed8266eca6c1) and outrageously restrictive ISO C++ TOS has been applied.

### Solution
However, license change is not retroactive, so the fact I've downloaded this logo before license change means I am not bound with TOS.
This way, I am free to distribute this logo for public domain and so I do. Feel free to use, modify, redistribute this logo and do whatever you want with it without any restrictions. Especially, no attribution to the author is required since author waived such requirement by putting this logo under public domain by [`ca05ec2`](https://github.com/isocpp/logos/commit/ca05ec2e9e6ec71343043d0d5f217e72f0fa3331).
